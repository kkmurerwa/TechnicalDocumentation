Kotlin is a statistically typed language that was unveiled in 2011 by JetBrains as part of the Kotlin Project. 
Its syntax is not compatible with JAVA but the language relies on the JAVA Virtual Machine(JVM) and can also run
JAVA code. Kotlin is compatible with up to JVM 11 as of the time of publishing this documentation(December 2018).
Kotlin uses type inference to determine the type of values and expressions for which type has been left unstated.
It incorporates the speed of C/C++ and the stability of JAVA to make an all-powerfull language that can be used for
any day-to-day programming problems. 

<br>
The lead developer of the Kotlin project, <b>Dimitri Jemerov</b> said they developed the language because no language 
had the features that they were looking for with the exception of Scala, which however, has a ver slow run-time. 
The name of the language comes from an island, Kotlin, near St. Petersburg. This was done in imitation of JAVAs name
derived from the Indonesian island of Java. The first stable version of the language was released in February 2016,
. JetBrains has committed to backwards compatibility from this version. The latest version of Kotlin is v1.3 that was 
released in October 2018. 
<br>
Kotlin is now supported by Google as of October 2017 alongside C/C++ and JAVA as the main languages used in
Android programming.

In order to get started with Kotlin, you are advised to visit the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kotlin-doc.html">
Official Kotlin Documantation</a> site. Once done, you require a Kotlin IDE. This can be an online IDE such as the one on
<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_kotlin_online.php">Tutorials Point</a> or a locally installed one. The lastest build
of the online compiler v1.3 can be downloaded at <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>. 
<br>
A shorter method would be to install the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows">IntelliJ IDEA</a> which comes
precompiled with the latest Kotlin compiler. Other IDEs that can be used include <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">
Visual Studio Code</a> and Eclipse. You however have to install the needed plugins in order to write Kotlin code on the latter IDEs.

  			<p>
Kotlin language has several data types. These include literals and numbers.
<h3>Numbers</h3>
There are numerous number types in Kotlin. These types and their properties are as listed below.
<ol type="a)">
	<li>Double - 64 bits</li>
	<li>Float - 32 bits</li>
	<li>Long - 64 bits</li>
	<li>Int - 32 bits</li>
	<li>Short - 16 bits</li>
	<li>Byte - 8 bits</li>
</ol>
<h3>Literals</h3>
Kotlin supports a wide number of literals. These include:
<ol type="a)">
	<li>Hexadecimals - 0x0F</li>
	<li>Binaries - 0b011010111</li>
	<li>Characters</li>
	<li>String</li>
	<li>Boolean</li>
	<li>Arrays</li>
</ol>
Kotlin, however, does not support Octal numbers.
<h3>Variable Declaration</h3>
Kotlin variables are declared using the keyword <i>val</i>
Below are some variable declarations and instantiations.
Data types in Kotlin, like Java, have to be declared explicitly as shown in the code below.
<center>
	<div class="code-box">
		<code>
			val text: Str = "I am text"<br>
			val integer: Int = 10 <br>
			val float: Float = 10.254 <br>
			val hex_Number: Hex = 0xFF <br>
		</code>
	</div>
</center>
